# Project-Cipher

This project is a Caesar Cipher implementation using Bootstrap for styling. It features an input form that allows the user to input a message, choose to encode or decode the message, and select key values for the encryption/decryption process. The JavaScript functions in the code handle the conversion and display the result in the output field in real-time as the user inputs the message.
